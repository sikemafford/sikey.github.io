  <P ...>While Paul Revere was on his <a href="http://ahp.gatech.edu/midnight_ride_1775.html">moonlit ride</a> to alert the countryside, &nbsp;he was detained by British soldiers who were posted outside of town.&nbsp;&nbsp;  One placed a pistol to Revere's head saying that Revere may want to give up some reliable information or they would "blow [his] brains out."&nbsp;&nbsp;Revere offered that the soldiers would be confronted by 500 militiamen soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon released after being deprived of his horse, Revere proceeded to Lexington on foot.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile,&nbsp; the news of approaching troops spread like wildfire throughout the countryside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Church bells rang and shots were fired into the night--all to alert the militia that had been assembling all night at <a href="https://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Summer06/images/lex_34.jpg">Lexington green</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexington green was a small,&nbsp;triangular section of land in the middle of town between forking roads--one of which led to the troop's destination: the Concord arsenal. &nbsp;&nbsp; A drum steadily rolled while the militamen,&nbsp;many ordinary family people (fathers, sons, grandfathers), &nbsp;came together.&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, Revere was allowed to pass through milita troops just ahead of the British soldiers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;They listened to a dreadfully slow and terrifying march of the seasoned, professional soldiers toward them.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;As the soldiers approached, the British troops saw what they would be confronting:&nbsp;&nbsp;several dozen men--a fraction of the British numbers.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The militiamen were ordered by the British commander to disperse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly outnumbered, they began to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Britsh troops attempted to flank and contain them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "shot heard 'round the world" rang out--the British said it was the militiamen; militiamen said it was the British who fired first. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Eight militiamen died.&nbsp;&nbsp;One British soldier was slightly wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp; The British commander,&nbsp; Pitcairn,'s horse was grazed by a bullet.

   <P ...>As the British left Lexington and marched toward Concord,&nbsp;more militiamen began their march to intercept the troops.&nbsp;Upon seeing the superior numbers, the militiamen retreated to a nearby hilltop.&nbsp;The British entered Concord and began destroying munitions as well as forcing the reluctant locals to sell them victuals. &nbsp;The militamen's alarm and fury were enflamed because many of the colonists believed that their homes had been set ablaze as well as their munitions destroyed.&nbsp;The militamen moved toward Conocord from the hilltop and confronted troops at <a href="http://www.emersonkent.com/images/lexington_concord.jpg">North Bridge</a>.&nbsp;Two colonists were killed.&nbsp;The British retreated to Concord to await reinforcements. &nbsp;The signaling bells continued to toll and the militia numbers continued to grow. &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reinforcements were slow to arrive, the British retreated to Boston from whence they came. As they marched (and to their utter outrage), militia fire came guerrilla-style from behind objects rather than in the honorable, upright and open way to which the British were accustomed to being perforated with lead.&nbsp;In the end,&nbsp;the battle was an embarassment to the British and a triumph for the colonists.&nbsp;Britsh losses were 73; American were 49.

<P ..>After Concord, a period of the war began in which the British were contained in the city of Boston.  It was know as <a href="*find link">the Seige of Boston</a>. During this time Washington was given command of the Continental Army

<P ..>The rebel army was in need of supplies during the Seige of Boston.&nbsp; Fort Ticonderoga could offer those supplies and a prime strategic location for controlling the northern region.&nbsp;Benedict Arnold manage to convince Massachusetts authorities to allow him to lead men in the capture of the fort. &nbsp; At the same time, Ethan Allen, leader of the Green Mountain boys of the New Hampshire Grants, was on the same mission. &nbsp; Neither willing to give up the glory of capturing the fort, they agreed--after a bit of debate--to a co-command of the forces.&nbsp;They slipped into the fort under cover of night while the troops there slept.  &nbsp;It was quickly surrendered and the ample stores of cannon were seized and sent to the Seige of Boston. &nbsp;This virtually bloodless capture was integral to eventual American control of Boston.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;A sleeping colonial giant had been awoken. After Lexington and Concord,&nbsp;the tables were turned on the soldiers in Boston who had once so insouciantly dominated the city.&nbsp;It was the <i>British troops</i> who were now being subjected to the intimidation of a vaste numbers of militiamen.&nbsp;In the dead of night, the militia managed to create two fortifications overlooking the entrenched enemy in Boston at <a href="http://cdn-3.britishbattles.com/images/bunker-hill/map.gif">Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill</a>, which gave them a strategic advantage. Three separate attacks were launched by the British until the colonists' supplies were exhausted and the British eventually took the fortification.&nbsp;The weary British soldiers did not pursue the retreating patriots.&nbsp;Though a loss for the patriots, the Battle of Bunker Hill was a tremendous morale booster for the patriots.  They knew they could hold their own against the formidable enemy.

 <p>
    <P ...> Because the colonists had shown themselves as a force to be reckoned with,&nbsp; Richard Penn and Arthur Lee (of the Continental Congress) felt that they had some leverage for a deal with the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing a forked-tongued offering first written by the pugnacious and eloquent Jefferson, the Congress settled on a kinder and gentler version by the more moderate John Dickinson.&nbsp;(Adams, ever the realist, sat out the affair and waited for the inevitable esclation of the conflict into a full-blown war.) The congress submitted a petition to King George, <a href="http://www.learner.org/workshops/primarysources/revolution/docs/olive.html">The Olive Branch Petition</a> in the hopes of achieving some sort of peace. &nbsp;The petition was openly intended to circumvent parliamentary authority and appeal directly to the king for some sort of reconciliation.

<P ..>War presents endless situations that require all the innovation and resourcefulness that humans can muster.&nbsp;&nbsp;On orders from General Washington, the young bookseller, Henry Knox, was given the logistically daunting task of transporting cannon 300 miles from captured<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html"> Fort Ticonderoga to Boston</a> to checkmate the British troops still occupying Boston. For two months he and his men and many oxen dragged 60 tons of cannon (munitions, etc.) weighing more than a Cadillac Escalade over land, water, and up and down hill after endless hill. The going was tough.&nbsp;&nbsp;His men at one point refused to go on,&nbsp;but Knox, evidently the consumate young leader, persuaded them to continue...

After a horrendous march through 350 miles of winter wilderness,&nbsp; Arnold&rsquo;s men (the ones who did not have the indecency to desert--or die) arrived half-starved at Quebec and eventually met up with Montgomery and his troops. &nbsp;The two launched their <a href="http://cdn-6.britishbattles.com/images/quebec/map-1775.jpg">two-pronged attack</a> as a winter storm sent snow sideways into the troops&rsquo; faces.  &nbsp;The Americans fought to no avail. &nbsp; Quebec would not so easily be taken.&nbsp;Montgomery died during the siege.&nbsp;  Arnold was wounded. &nbsp;American losses were heavy (500); British were minimal (20). &nbsp; Arnold eventually withdrew his forces.
